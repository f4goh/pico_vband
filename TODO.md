There are a number of feature enhancements we could add.

- Add a MIDI USB device so we can do local sound output with less latency. The
  github nealey/vail-adapter has MIDI support code.
- Add a local buzzer, for direct key press feedback. Piezo probably easier than magnetic buzzer.
- Add a remote LED, for when we mount the board in a case.
